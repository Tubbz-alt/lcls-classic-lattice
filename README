1. To acquire the LCLS lattice files by CVS

   Set the location of the CVS repository that your CVS client will use.
   In unix that may be done by setting the CVSROOT environment variable, for
   instance if using a bourne shell variabnt like bash:

      export CVSROOT=":ext:<YOURUSERNAME>@noric.slac.stanford.edu:/afs/slac/g/lcls/cvs"   

   where <YOURUSERNAME> is your login id on the remote computer.
    
   Then you can cvs checkout the lattice files, e.g.:

      cvs co optics/etc/lattice/lcls


2. To compute optics using MAD8

   Having acquired the lattice files, such as with CVS above, then
   cd to the directory containing your mad8 input files. These are probably
   named *.mad8 and *.xsif. Then execute the mad8 command on the mad8 file, e.g.:

      cd optics/etc/lattice/lcls
      mad8 LCLS_MAIN.mad8

3. Using "make" for running lattice, making maps, and installing products
 
      make                   - Run mad8 on LCLS_MAIN.mad8 
      make maps              - Make the device lists and maps
      make install           - Copies the lattice files output from mad8, 
                               to /afs/slac/www/grp/ad/model/output/<today>/
   also (rarely used)                          
      make icons             - Make the icons for the web site
      make installicons      - Copies web icons to the web site
